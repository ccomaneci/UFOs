# UFOs

## Overview
The anomaly of UFO sighting can cause fear, amusement, and wonder, but how often are UFO sightings seen? Using some of the coding language that we have learned so far, we were able to create a webpage that allows us to filter sighting data and determine just how often sightings of UFO are seen. 

## Results
We created search fields that allow us to filter the data by date, city, state, country, and shape of the object seen during the sighting. This is so that we can break down the data further and help determine a conclusion as to if the UFO sightings are potentially real or presumed false. 

## Summary 
Being able to add filters to our webpage made it easy to sort through the dataset provided. However, if there was one thing, I could change would be to combine some of the filters into one easy search field.
